    "The file browser implemented in the \"files in Python\" notebook is a handy tool.   Create a file in python that holds a function called \"file_choose\" that creates the file browser and then returns the file path the user selects.  This should be in it's own .py file, with no other content.   Then import this file into a Jupyter notebook and show that you can call \"file_choose\" and then open the selected file.  Print out the first line of the file on the screen.\n"
